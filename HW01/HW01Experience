Describe your experience with this assignment

1. What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any?
   I didn't consider about the condition if a triangle belongs to multiple types, thus I used more if sentence to handle
   this issue.

2. What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
   First, all the parameters entered by users should be check if valid, because the input values are the length of
   triangle sizes.(Check if values are numeral)
   Check if the three sizes provided can form a triangle.
   Check the feature of the formed triangle and match to the 4 types. (Can match to multiple types)
   The result should be (only) a string and show the type(s) of the formed triangle.

3. What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
   No too much, just spend a few time on reviewing unittest. Don't know why the IDE warns me that I don't have PyTest
   when I just use UnitTest.

4. Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
   I used 12 test cases to test the result of the program which cover all the situations. For each of them, I wrote 2
   cases. I didn't put the input check and triangle classification together and my function of input check needs
   parameters given by user(keyboard). Because it's easier to maintain and user-friendly.
